Hi there! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the "Data Science and Computation" course at the University of Bologna and the Italian Institute of Technology. My research interests are Molecular Dynamics simulations and the integration of machine learning techniques with classical computational tools for drug discovery.

### Some information about me 
I was born and raised in a small town near Brescia, Italy. I moved to Bologna to pursue a Single-cycle Master's degree in Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Technology. For my master's thesis, I completed a 12-month-long internship in the laboratory of Professors Matteo Masetti, Andrea Cavalli, and Maurizio Recanatini which resulted in a thesis entitled "Integration of simulative approaches and machine learning in the study of receptor complexes of pharmaceutical interest." Currently, I am enrolled in the second year of a four-year Ph.D. program at the same university. During this time, I am also serving as the teaching assistant for the computational laboratory component of the course "Advanced Methodologies in Medicinal Chemistry," which is led by Dr. Federico Falchi.

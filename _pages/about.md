Hi there! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the "Data Science and Computation" course at the University of Bologna and the Italian Institute of Technology. My research interests are Molecular Dynamics simulations and the integration of machine learning techniques with classical computational tools for drug discovery.

### About me
I was born and grew up in a small town near Brescia, Italy. I moved to Bologna to pursue my Single-cycle Master's degree in Pharmaceutical Chemistry and Technology. I did a 12-month-long internship for my master's thesis in the laboratory of Prof. Matteo Masetti and Prof. Andrea Cavalli, which resulted in a thesis entitled "Integration of simulative approaches and machine learning in the study of receptor complexes of pharmaceutical interest." I am currently enrolled in the second year of a four-year-long Ph.D. program at the same university.
During these years, I am the TA for the computational laboratory of the course "Advanced Methodologies in Medicinal Chemistry" led by Dr. Federico Falchi.
